Photo Scout is a simple Magnolia "content app":http://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Content+app+framework, showing photos from Instagram, and allowing to suggest photos to editors through tasks in the Pulse.

h2. OAuth credentials required

In order to establish connection to Instagram's API, OAuth credentials are required. You need to register on Instagram's developer site to get these -- see http://instagram.com/developer.

The following three keys should then be configured in your _magnolia.properties_:

* @instagram.oauth.clientId@
* @instagram.oauth.clientSecret@
* @instagram.oauth.accessToken@
